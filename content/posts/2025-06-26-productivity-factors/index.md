Notes on the section [Guide to Productivity Factors​](https://docs.aisystant.com/ru/rational-work/guide-to-productivity-factors.html) from Rational Work.

## Sleep

Things aren’t too bad, apart from a messed-up schedule.

I probably won’t be able to improve the sleep environment much — maybe just tweak the air conditioner so it turns on and off automatically to maintain the set temperature. Right now, it shuts off when it hits 25°C and stays off until morning. But it’s not too hot lately, so it’s fine.

I’ll get the schedule back on track.

## Leisure

This one’s bad. Most of my time gets eaten up by doomscrolling. I’ve made tackling it one of my goals for the course — but to do that, I need to learn (ideally with good reasoning) how to choose priorities. The brain just works in a way where it’s easier to zone out than, say, try out a new hobby.

I did want to try different types of sports at some point, or just change the scenery a bit. That always helps clear my head (and fits the definition of good-quality leisure), but I’m too lazy to look things up or go somewhere.

Again, this can be solved with rational work on prioritization.

Funny enough, that’s exactly what Task 7.7 is about (called it), but I still have to get there. Time to think.

## Current workload

It’s recommended to adopt some kind of task management approach — like GTD. The same issue always comes up: you end up juggling two queues — team trackers and your personal to-dos. That’s where I always break. If I create my own todo list, I stop updating the team’s. If I focus on the team’s and get it nicely organized, I start convincing myself it’s enough (like, I’ve polished it to perfection — surely that counts).

Still, I think I’ll give it another go.

I’ll just dump everything I’m working on into Obsidian and sort it by priority. The key is not to overcomplicate it — no hierarchies, no structure, no metadata fields. Just a list. The simpler, the better. I remember trying the “autofocus” method once. Similar principles — pick from the top, move unfinished stuff to the bottom. If you defer a task, you rewrite it at the end. In the end, I just kept rewriting.

I’ll go into more detail when I reach Section 5.

This also ties into calendar work. I’m doing okay-ish there. For some reason, I stick to plans with other people — but not with myself.

## Work mode

The recommendation here is to focus on no more than 1–2 main projects — the ones you give your full attention to — and put the rest in the background. If I understand it correctly, you’re supposed to get to version 4 of a working product with small iterations, then switch to the next one.

Sounds good in theory, but you have to test it in practice. If you really dive into one task without distractions, instead of jumping between projects, the results will obviously be better (and faster). But I’m still not sure how to handle abrupt context switches, like when a client calls and asks for something right now. Maybe I should start saying something like, “Can I finish what I’m doing in the next 30 minutes first?” We’ll see. I’ll try managing tasks in Obsidian and see how it goes.

## Ability to quickly (re)prioritize

This one flows logically from the previous section.

The idea is to have a list of all tasks, sorted by priority. You always take the first one to work on (preferably just one at a time). You do it. Cross it off. When something new comes in, add it to the end of the list and re-prioritize. Ideally, don’t drop what you’re doing — unless it’s a real exception.

The key here, I think, is that prioritization itself shouldn’t be mentally taxing. If sorting takes too long or is annoying, I just won’t do it. Same with opening the app — if it’s hard to find or access, I’m not going to use it. Any friction like that needs to be identified and removed, step by step.

## Quality of work artifacts

Nothing new here either — work fast and show early.

It’ll take five tries to get it right. The first draft definitely won’t be perfect, so either get used to starting with “meh” and improving over time — or don’t do anything at all, which makes even less sense[^1].

The only thing left is to start following through. That’s always the hardest part. But that’s why we’re here. And this post is one of those imperfect steps[^2] toward the world of “continuous everything.”
