Answers to the questions from the Checklist for Organizing Work Development Sessions. Keeping it short for now—it’s still early days. Might be worth revisiting these later (maybe mid-way and at the end of the internship).

>	1.	Do I take the work development sessions seriously? How does that show?

Yes. This time around I made a few public commitments, plus I record videos of the sessions themselves. I also run them using an actual workflow—Pomodoro timer, logging everything in the exocortex.

And it feels like I’ve framed my expectations from the internship as developing a new business[^1] (haven’t fleshed this part out too much yet though).

>	2.	Are the key productivity factors in place for me? How do I know?

Yes and no. I wrote a blog post about it, outlined next steps, and plan to track progress throughout the internship.

>	3.	Have I allocated and scheduled time for the work development sessions—and am I actually doing them?

Time is allocated and scheduled, but I’m not really sticking to it yet. I try, but so far I mostly fall back to backup time—can’t seem to wake up early enough to start with them. Still, working on it. Today, for example, I actually managed to pull it off.

>	4.	Is the allocated time working well for the sessions (i.e., I’m getting value from using the materials)?

I’ve only gone through the introduction so far.

>	5.	Have I measured my pace through the guide at least once and used it for planning future sessions?

Not yet, but I’m planning to start doing this during the weekly reviews.

>	6.	Have I set a reminder to post my progress (if I’m doing the internship with mentors), and do I follow through on those reminders?

I’m doing the internship solo, but I try to write a blog post for each section I read.

>	7.	Am I focused on getting to the fourth version of the work product quickly, rather than putting all my energy into a perfect first version (which won’t be perfect anyway)?

Still trying to convince myself of that.

>	8.	Do I review the results of my work development sessions?

Yes—as blog posts. I also plan to do weekly summaries here on the blog, but this is just week one.
