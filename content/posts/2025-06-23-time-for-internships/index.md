title: Time for Internships
---

As part of the “Rational Work” internship, I need to reflect and choose time for work sessions.

Investing time in going through internships is not a waste (I’m getting smarter, after all) — on the contrary, it’s useful.

Arguably, this is one of the most important investments, so it makes sense to put other things aside and focus on the internship.

What am I giving up? I’ll try to give up pointless doomscrolling. That’s a separate topic — won’t go into it here, maybe I’ll reflect more on it later. I think I’ll be able to free up a decent amount of time this way.

To do that, I simply lock my phone in a safe and don’t touch it during the day. I can allow a few moments of weakness — but just a few times a day, no more. Ideally in the evening, after everything else is done.

Conclusion — allocate time in the morning, first thing after waking up and doing the morning ritual. I’ll write more about the morning rituals later.

At 11 I sometimes have other things starting (sometimes later), so I need to begin the internship earlier.

Here’s roughly the plan:

Wake up at 9:00, ritual (including breakfast) — until 10, and at 10 I start the internship. This will be hard with my current broken schedule, I’m afraid it won’t work out. But I need to track the changes and how well I stick to my agreements with myself (that’s a separate conversation too, by the way).

From 10 to 11 — internship, then go about my day. Alternatively (if I can’t fix my schedule right away) — push other things back (if possible) and start the day with 2 work sessions. Wake up and straight into work development. That will also help cut out doomscrolling in the morning.

From 20:00 to 22:00 in the evening I sometimes have extra time that can be invested in myself. I’ll use it as backup time, if I oversleep in the morning and can’t shift my schedule.

And I think I’ll easily be able to free up an extra hour during the day by cutting out phone use.

The most important thing here — is just to start the session. Which means I need a certain ritual. In my case, it’s semi-public accountability via a YouTube channel where I stream my work sessions (the channel is private for now, because I want to test myself first). But I need to stop being afraid to launch those sessions. Just start doing it.

Sounds like a plan.
