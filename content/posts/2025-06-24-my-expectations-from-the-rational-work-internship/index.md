My Expectations from the Rational Work Internship

Reading the section What You Need to Know for Successful Guide Application from the Rational Work guide.

It invites me to reflect on two questions (apart from the ones I already covered in a previous post):
	- Why do I even want to go through this internship? What results am I expecting?
	- What will I do when my schedule inevitably falls apart again and something new lands on me? What will I choose to focus my time and attention on?

I decided to postpone answering these and keep reading (spoiler: some answers showed up in the text itself).

Wrote down a few thoughts that stuck with me.

Don’t try to get it perfect from the start — focus on trying things quickly.
	- Take small steps (small batch size)
	- Reduce work in progress

One interesting suggestion: pick a single project and push it all the way to version 4 of a working product, without switching to anything else. Sounds tough, but 4 isn’t that many. Worth a shot.

Also, it’s important to be able to return to abandoned projects — if they’re still relevant.

Now to the actual questions.

I want to do this internship to become a master of focus — to learn how to concentrate on what truly matters (and first, to figure out what that even is for me right now). Seems like a core skill, something everything else is built on. I’d even call it mental health, in the foundational sense.

If some important project (as judged by me at that moment) ends up pushing out the time I’d planned for the internship, I promise myself (not that I’m great at keeping promises to myself, but I’ll try [^1]):
	1.	To reflect in writing on why that happened — why I decided that project was more important than mastering focus
	2.	To schedule a new work session on the next available day to get back to the internship

Looks like it’s going to be hard — but also interesting.

[^1]: Honestly, this might be part of the same focus problem too.
