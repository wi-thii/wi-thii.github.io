Thoughts on the section [How to Intern](https://docs.aisystant.com/ru/rational-work/how-to-intern.html).

One counterintuitive idea that stands out is the shift from educational language to action-oriented thinking: it’s a guide, not a book for entertainment. You’re not supposed to “read to get smarter,” you’re supposed to take it and do things.

In general, reading “just in case” or trying to “self-develop for the future” feels like a utopia. Life’s too short for that.

This isn’t my first time going through the Engineers-Manager Workshop program, but this time I plan to follow the guide independently. And this time, I’m documenting the process. My first clear goal: to make it to the end of the internship[^1] without dropping off. Simple and measurable.

There are also a few non-public goals I have in mind — I might talk about them later, once I’m ready (or once I reach them). Right now, it feels like I just don’t have the words to frame them properly, which makes them feel “not ready” to share.

One challenge (and I doubt I’m the only one) is choosing a project for the internship. Since I’ve chosen the path of working in public[^2], it has to be a project I can openly talk about, without any NDAs. And realistically, I don’t have any like that right now (zero). So I’m leaning toward launching a new AI-related project to use as my training ground. It’s not a “practice” project — there’s real skin in the game — but at the same time, it won’t cause issues with existing clients who wouldn’t want internal details leaking. And ideally, I’d like to take this new project somewhere serious[^3].

Here we go.

[^1]: Or is it more accurate to say “self-internship” here?
[^2]: Okay, semi-public. For now.
[^3]: Even though I’m not entirely sure yet where it’ll lead.
